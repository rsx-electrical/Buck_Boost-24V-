# Buck_Boost
Designed to provide a regulated 24V output from a 6S (24V nominal) battery pack with an input range of about 19–25V.
Intended for use in a rover system powering comms hardware (TpLink POE; JETSON AGX ORIN).

# Specs 
Vin: 19–25V (6S Li-ion pack)
Vout: 24V nominal
Estimated power: 100W total (More than sum of both loads, some margin for overhead and future changes)

# Notes
Design is still in development; input range, component choices, and power ratings may change. Focus is on stable 24V output, good efficiency, and reliable operation in a mobile rover environment.Future updates will include board revisions, layout improvements, and performance testing.
