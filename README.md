# Buck_Boost
Designed to provide a regulated 24V output from a 6S (24V nominal) battery pack with an input range of about 19â€“25V.
Intended for use in a rover system powering comms hardware (TpLink POE; JETSON AGX ORIN).

#Workflow
1. Message Discord that you are working in the repo. Nobody else can work on it once you message.
2. git clone git@github.com:rsx-electrical/Buck_Boost-24V-.git
3. Edit 4_switch_Buck_Boost
4. Save a zip file version of your finished work into History Folder. 
- File should named <date/time>_<name>_<brief_description_of_changes>
5. Stage the files you want to commit. See "How to commit changes" bellow. 
6. git commit -m <commit message>
7. git push
8. Yay:). You are done

# Specs 
Vin: 19â€“25V (6S Li-ion pack)
Vout: 24V nominal
Estimated power: 100W total (More than sum of both loads, some margin for overhead and future changes)

# Notes
Design is still in development; input range, component choices, and power ratings may change. Focus is on stable 24V output, good efficiency, and reliable operation in a mobile rover environment.Future updates will include board revisions, layout improvements, and performance testing.

# How to commit changes
A file with changes can be in one of three states: untracked, modified, or staged. Only staged files are included in the next commit. 
- git status : command to see the status of the files youÕve modified
##Staged files
Staged changes are changes in files that have been marked in git to be included in the next commit. The section labeled "Changes to be committed" in git status shows these staged files.
If you stage a file and then make additional changes to it, those new changes are not staged and will not be included in the next commit. To include them, you need to stage the file again.
- git add <file_name> : command to stage a file
- git add . : stage all files with changes in them. Be careful as this will also stage untracked files which often we do not want to be staged. 
- git restore --staged <file> : command to unstage a file
##Tracked Files
Tracked files are files that git is already monitoring for changes, meaning they were previously committed and git keeps track of any modifications to them. 
##Untracked files
Untracked files are files in your working directory that Git does not yet know about. These are sometimes autogenerated files or files for certain settings in your local repo. An example on a Mac is .DS_Store. This .DS_Store file s a hidden file created by macOS in folders to store custom metadata about that folder, like icon positions, view settings, and window size. This is not a file that we want pushed to the remote repository.
